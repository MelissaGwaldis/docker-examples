# DockerContainerRun
Show syntax and capabilities of creating a container and executing some command after it starts.
Examples will include various commands and their outputs or lack of it.

1. Perform 'ls -l' from inside of a container
1. Perform 'echo ...' command to generate command line output
1. Invoke shell ('sh') and demonstrate lack of output

Note, that each command created a separate container. These containers are not running once the command completed, but remain in the system.
